# yeasterday weather


## Basic Details
### individual: Linna Therees Joy


### Project Description
Yesterday’s Weather Forecaster is a completely useless app that confidently reports yesterday’s weather as if it’s breaking news. It’s perfect for people who love knowing what they just experienced

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People desperately need to know yesterday’s weather — even though they already lived through it. Our app solves this non-existent problem with full passion and zero practicality.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A dramatic weather forecast app that tells you exactly what happened yesterday — with alerts, suggestions, and style — solving nothing, but doing it beautifully.
