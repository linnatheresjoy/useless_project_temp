Project Description
Yesterday’s Weather Forecaster is a completely useless app that confidently reports yesterday’s weather as if it’s breaking news. It’s perfect for people who love knowing what they just experienced

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People desperately need to know yesterday’s weather — even though they already lived through it. Our app solves this non-existent problem with full passion and zero practicality.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A dramatic weather forecast app that tells you exactly what happened yesterday — with alerts, suggestions, and style — solving nothing, but doing it beautifully.
